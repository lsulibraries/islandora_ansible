TAHIL providers include the Louisiana State Archives,  Louisiana State Museum, The Historic New Orleans Collection and Tulane  Univers ity Library Special Collections. </p><p></p><p>The Huey Long Digital Collection  contains original documents concerning depression-era Louisiana and  detailing Huey P. Long's ""Share Our Wealth"" program.   From the Historic  New Orleans Collection, a variety of original broadsides and speeches  offer insight into the popular appeal of Long's Louisiana program.  Sample ballots and election posters from Tulane's Special Collections  document Long's bid for public office.  In personal correspondence, also  from Tulane's Special Collections, Long compares his efforts to enact  ""old age"" pensions with FDR's efforts at the national level.   Transportation maps provided by the Louisiana State Museum illustrate  the results of Long's massive road-building program.  Opposition to  Long's programs is documented by newspaper articles, broadsides and  legislative appeals sponsored by a variety of Louisiana political and  economic groups including Standard Oil and the Louisiana Women's  Committee.  Of particular note, from THNOC manuscript holdings, a couple  of letters from author Ezra Pound related to Long's death speak to the  worldwide implications of this event and perceptions that Long's views  that were progressive and important. A compilation of Long's speeches is  also a part of the digital record being offered by THNOC and Tulane  University Library's Special Collections. </p>"
